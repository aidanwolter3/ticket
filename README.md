# ticket

A local-first ticket tracker built for AI-human collaborative development. Agents pick up work, humans review and direct — `ticket` manages the state machine, git worktrees, and review threads that tie it all together.

## Goals

- **Agent-friendly CLI** — every state transition is a single command, easy to script from an agent loop
- **Human-controlled reviews** — humans drive the review→approve→merge path; agents can't bypass it
- **Iterative amendments** — threaded review comments automatically generate amendment tasks for the next round, so feedback is always traceable to specific work
- **Local-first** — SQLite on disk, no network dependencies, no accounts

## Workflow

```
draft → ready → in_progress → in_review → approved → merged
                                  ↕
                              (amendment rounds)
```

### 1. Human: create a ticket

```sh
ticket draft --title "Add login feature" --repo /path/to/repo
ticket task add T1 --title "Implement JWT auth" --verifiable-result "Tests pass"
ticket task add T1 --title "Add /login endpoint"
ticket ready T1
```

### 2. Agent: work

The agent is dispatched by the TUI (`agent.auto_dispatch`) and pre-assigned to a specific ticket. It does the work and transitions to review:

```sh
# ... do the work (agent is pre-assigned via TUI dispatch) ...
ticket --agent task complete --commit <hash> <task-id>   # or --most-recent-commit
# for no_commit tasks (verification-only, no code change):
ticket --agent task complete <task-id>
ticket --agent in-review T1
```

### 3. Human: review

Open the TUI (`ticket`) and navigate to the `in_review` ticket. Press `[R]` to open the **review panel** — a split-pane view with tasks on the left and the git diff for the selected task on the right.

- **Navigate tasks** with `↑/k` and `↓/j` in the left pane. Tasks without a commit are greyed out and show a placeholder instead of a diff.
- **Switch panes** with `Tab`. When the right pane is focused, `↑/k` and `↓/j` scroll the diff.
- **Leave a hunk-anchored comment** with `[c]` — captures the file path and the nearest `@@` hunk header above the current scroll position. A modal opens to type the comment. After confirmation the thread appears inline directly below the hunk it was anchored to.
- **Submit the review** with `[S]` — sends all staged comments to the agent, auto-generates amendment tasks, and transitions the ticket back to `ready`.
- **Approve** with `[a]` once all threads are resolved — transitions to `approved` (requires no open threads).

### 4. Agent: amend

When the ticket returns to `ready` with `needs_attention` threads, the agent addresses each thread using fixup commits:

```sh
# For each amended task (task_commit_hash is the task's stored commit_hash):
git commit --fixup=<task_commit_hash>

# After all fixup commits are staged, autosquash:
GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=true git rebase -i --autosquash main

# Update stored commit hashes after rebase:
ticket --agent task set-commit <task-id> <new-hash>

# Force-push the cleaned history:
git push --force-with-lease origin <feature-branch>
```

Repeat steps 3–4 until satisfied.

### 5. Human: approve and merge

Use TUI keybindings: `[a]` to approve (transitions `in_review → approved`), `[m]` to merge
(fast-forward merges branch, cleans up worktree, transitions to `merged`).

## Installation

```sh
go install ./cmd/ticket
```

Requires Go 1.21+. The database is created automatically at `~/.local/share/ticket/tickets.db` on first run.

## Claude Code skill

This repository ships a `/ticket` Claude Code skill at `.claude/skills/ticket/SKILL.md`. Claude Code loads it automatically when you open this project, so the `/ticket` command is available without any manual setup.

The skill lets you file new tickets from within Claude Code:

```
/ticket add a login rate-limiter to the auth service
```

The global copy at `~/.claude/skills/ticket/SKILL.md` is a symlink to this file — there is only one canonical copy.

## TUI

Run `ticket` with no arguments to open the interactive interface.

| `t` | Open threads view |
| `[` / `]` | Scroll detail pane up / down |
| `g` | Dispatch agent |
| `enter` | Attach agent session |
| `shift+tab` | Cycle to next agent |
| `ctrl+]` | Detach agent |
| `a` | Approve in-review ticket |
| `m` | Merge approved ticket |
| `n` | Add note |
| `X` | Revert to draft (in-progress / in-review) |
| `C` | Add conflict-resolution task and requeue |
| `D` | Delete ticket |
| `q` | Quit |

**Threads view** (`t` from any ticket):

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `↑/k` `↓/j` | Navigate threads |
| `n` | New thread |
| `r` | Reply to thread |
| `x` | Resolve / reopen thread |

Approve and merge are human-only operations performed via the TUI (`[a]` to approve, `[m]` to merge).

## Data model

- **Ticket** — unit of work; has status, feature branch, and worktree path
- **Task** — ordered step within a ticket; tagged with a `round` (1 = original, 2+ = amendments)
- **Thread** — review comment attached to a task; statuses: `open` → `needs_attention` → `resolved`
- **Draft state** — staged human edits (new threads, replies, resolve decisions) submitted via the TUI

## Configuration

```sh
ticket config set worktrees false         # disable automatic worktree creation
ticket config set agent.command 'claude --prompt {}'   # command used to dispatch agents
ticket config set agent.auto_dispatch true             # auto-dispatch agents when a ticket becomes ready
```

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `worktrees` | `true` | Create a git worktree when a ticket becomes ready |
| `agent.command` | _(unset)_ | Command to run as an agent; `{}` is replaced with the dispatched skill file contents |
| `agent.auto_dispatch` | `false` | If `true`, automatically dispatch an agent whenever a ticket transitions to `ready` |

`agent.command` must contain `{}` — the system substitutes the dispatched skill file contents in its place. Setting it without `{}` is a validation error.

Default config location: `~/.local/share/ticket/tickets.db` (same database, config table).

## Repository layout

```
cmd/ticket/        entry point — dispatches to cli or tui, launches TUI when run with no args
internal/
  cli/             CLI interface — one file per subcommand (draft, ready, task, …)
  tui/             TUI interface — Bubbletea app, views, and reusable components
    views/         full-screen views (ticket list, ticket detail, threads)
    components/    reusable widgets (progress bar, status icon)
  workflow/
    human/         orchestration layer for human operations: draft, ready, redraft, merge,
                   task/thread management, and agent transition proxies
    agent/         standalone agent workflow functions (start-work, submit-for-review, etc.)
  store/           SQLite persistence — schema, migrations, per-entity CRUD
  model/           data types and state machine rules
  ids/             sequential ID generation (T1, T2, …)
```

`cli/` and `tui/` are parallel interfaces that both go through `workflow/human` — neither imports `store` directly. A `depguard` linter rule enforces this boundary.
